Spatula is an interpreter for the Silverware+ programming language, a lightly Lisp-inspired programming language. It is a noticeable improvement in comparison
with [Silverware](https://github.com/Dr-Nekoma/spoon). The plus version of the language adds several new features,
such as Records (both Nominal and Anonymous), Algebraic Data Types (ADTs), Pattern Matching, and Parametric Polymorphism.
