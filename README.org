Spatula is an interpreter for the Silverware+ programming language, a lightly Lisp-inspired programming language. It is a noticeable improvement in comparison
with [[https://github.com/Dr-Nekoma/spoon][Silverware]]. The plus version of the language adds several new features,
such as Records (both Nominal and Anonymous), Algebraic Data Types (ADTs), Pattern Matching, and Parametric Polymorphism.
  
** How to use Spatula 

Multiple flags are available for spatula, including passing a file for execution as well as using special flags for debugging purposes. Use
`--help` to expose all the flags.
